            Hi, my name is Tim Mellis and I live in the Pacific North West. There are big trees, big mountains, big skies, and a big ocean. I was born here. I’ve travelled around the globe. I’m an older male. I like bike riding and building things… like perfume. 
            <br>
            <br>
            I’ve spent many years learning to make perfume. Like many things, I’m self taught. I like learning on my own. I love the alchemy of perfumery. I studied chemistry in college. I’ve read every book on perfumery and watched every video.  Some of the essential oils in Cupid’s Arrow are expensive and hard to come by which increases its mystique. 
            <br>
            <br>            
            I’m always working on new compositions. Everything is made personally by me. I work in small batches rather than mass supply through a machine. I only use the best ingredients to make the best possible fragrance.    
            <br>
            <br>            
            I ship orders within 24 hours (usually far less). 
            <br>
            <br>            
            Since I made Cupid’s Arrow and seen its results, I’ve decided to sell it online. Now as my company is in its infancy stage, I’m busy with everything. The contact form on the purchase page of this website is instant or real time. If there are any problems with your order, please contact me and I will reimburse or resend your order.  
            <br>
            <br>            
            If you wear Cupid’s Arrow, he will be sitting on both your shoulders with bow locked and loaded with an unlimited quiver of arrows.
            <br>
            <br>
            Thank you,
            <br>
            <br>
            Tim Mellis
